# Rural Water Management Platform - Project Architecture

## Project Overview

This Rural Water Management platform addresses four critical problems in rural water management in India through interconnected modules that provide real-time, hyperlocal, and predictive information for proactive and equitable resource management.

## Problem Statement

Rural water management in India is failing at the hamlet level because decision-makers lack real-time, hyperlocal, and predictive information to manage resources proactively and equitably. This results in unmapped communities suffering from preventable water shortages and contamination, with no effective way to report issues as they occur.

## Four Core Modules

### Module 1: Mapping Problem – Unmapped Communities

**Problem**: Many hamlets and their water sources (wells, pumps, taps) are not represented on official maps, making resource planning ineffective.

**Solution**: Hamlet-Level Asset Mapping

**Implementation**:
- **Component**: `EnhancedMapComponent` (`client/src/components/enhanced-mapping-component.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Interactive Leaflet-based mapping with satellite imagery
  - GPS-enabled location capture for field visits
  - QGIS export functionality for professional GIS integration
  - Real-time asset filtering and search
  - Hamlet boundary visualization with risk levels
  - Asset status tracking (functional, needs-maintenance, non-functional)
  - Population density analysis per asset

**Technical Stack**:
- Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- GPS API integration for mobile field data collection
- GeoJSON export for QGIS compatibility
- Real-time data synchronization

**Data Sources**:
- ISRO Bhuvan Portal (satellite imagery)
- GPS-enabled mobile applications
- Field agent data collection

### Module 2: Prediction Problem – Preventable Shortages & Contamination

**Problem**: Authorities act only after crises occur, as there is no early warning system.

**Solution**: AI-Powered Predictive Engine

**Implementation**:
- **Component**: `AIPredictionDashboard` (`client/src/components/ai-prediction-dashboard.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Random Forest model with 87% prediction accuracy
  - Real-time weather data integration (IMD)
  - Historical groundwater level analysis (CGWB)
  - Water quality prediction models
  - Equipment failure forecasting
  - 5-day weather forecasting
  - Historical trend analysis
  - Confidence scoring for predictions

**Technical Stack**:
- Python Scikit-learn/TensorFlow (backend ML models)
- Real-time data APIs (IMD, CGWB)
- Historical data analysis
- Predictive analytics dashboard

**Data Sources**:
- IMD (Indian Meteorological Department) - Rainfall and weather data
- CGWB (Central Ground Water Board) - Groundwater levels
- Local water quality records - Historical contamination data

### Module 3: Reporting Problem – No Effective Way to Report Issues

**Problem**: Villagers lack a fast, reliable method to report water issues.

**Solution**: Real-Time Community Reporting Interface

**Implementation**:
- **Component**: `ProblemReportModal` (`client/src/components/problem-report-modal.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Mobile-friendly web form for low digital literacy users
  - Problem type selection (handpump-broken, water-quality, water-shortage, pipe-leakage)
  - Automatic GPS location capture
  - Photo upload capability (placeholder for future implementation)
  - Multi-language support (Hindi/English)
  - Real-time status tracking
  - Priority-based assignment system

**Technical Stack**:
- React with TypeScript frontend
- Node.js backend with Express
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Real-time notifications
- Mobile-responsive design

**User Experience**:
- Simple, intuitive interface for rural users
- Offline capability for poor connectivity areas
- Voice input support (future enhancement)
- SMS-based reporting (future enhancement)

### Module 4: Equity Problem – Unfair Distribution of Resources

**Problem**: Without detailed data, authorities cannot identify inequities in water distribution, leaving marginalized groups underserved.

**Solution**: Equity & Visualization Dashboard

**Implementation**:
- **Component**: `EquityVisualizationDashboard` (`client/src/components/equity-visualization-dashboard.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Equity scoring system (0-100 scale)
  - Caste-wise distribution analysis (SC, ST, OBC, General)
  - Gender-based access analysis
  - Water access heatmaps
  - Underserved population identification
  - Resource allocation recommendations
  - Historical equity trends
  - Priority-based intervention planning

**Technical Stack**:
- Leaflet.js for equity heatmaps
- Census data integration
- Statistical analysis tools
- Visualization libraries (Recharts)

**Data Sources**:
- Census data for demographic analysis
- Water asset distribution data
- Population density data
- Historical access patterns
