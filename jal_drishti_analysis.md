# Jal Drishti - Project Workflow & System Analysis

## Overview

Jal Drishti is a full-stack rural water management platform designed to address mapping, prediction, reporting, and equity challenges in Indian villages. It provides dashboards and tools for community members, field agents, and administrators, enabling data-driven decision-making and proactive resource management.

## Workflow Summary

### 1. User Authentication & Role-Based Access

- Users register and log in via the React frontend.
- Authentication is handled using JWT tokens, managed by the Express.js backend.
- Role-based access (community, agent, admin) determines dashboard views and available features.

### 2. Mapping & Asset Management

- Field agents and admins map water assets (handpumps, wells, tanks, etc.) using GPS-enabled forms and interactive Leaflet maps.
- Asset data is stored in PostgreSQL and visualized in real-time on the frontend.
- Hamlet boundaries and risk levels are displayed for planning and analysis.

### 3. Problem Reporting & Status Tracking

- Community members report water issues (e.g., broken pumps, contamination) via mobile-friendly forms.
- Reports include GPS location, asset reference, and optional photos.
- Status of reported problems is tracked and updated by agents/admins.

### 4. AI-Powered Prediction & Alerts

- The backend integrates with external APIs (IMD, CGWB) and uses historical data to predict water shortages and contamination risks.
- Predictions are displayed on dashboards, with risk levels and recommended actions.

### 5. Equity Analysis & Visualization

- The system analyzes water access equity using demographic and asset data.
- Dashboards show equity scores, caste/gender distribution, underserved populations, and resource allocation recommendations.
- Heatmaps and trends help identify areas needing intervention.

## System Architecture

- **Frontend (client):** React 18 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Leaflet.js, Wouter, TanStack Query
- **Backend (server):** Node.js + Express.js, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, JWT authentication, RESTful APIs
- **Database:** Tables for users, hamlets, water assets, problem reports, water quality tests, predictions, tasks, maintenance records, notifications
- **DevOps:** Vite build tool, environment configs, PWA support

---

## Main User Flows

1. **Registration/Login:**  
   - User creates account, receives JWT token, and is routed to their dashboard based on role.

2. **Dashboard Access:**  
   - Community: Report problems, view status, basic map.
   - Agent: Asset mapping, water testing, problem resolution.
   - Admin: System overview, analytics, equity dashboard, resource management.

3. **Reporting & Resolution:**  
   - Community submits report → Backend stores report → Agent/Admin updates status → User tracks resolution.

4. **Mapping & Visualization:**  
   - Assets and hamlets visualized on interactive maps → Data updated in real-time → Export options for GIS tools.

5. **Prediction & Alerts:**  
   - Backend processes data and external API feeds → AI models generate predictions → Dashboards display risks and recommendations.

6. **Equity Analysis:**  
   - System calculates equity scores and underserved populations → Visualizations guide resource allocation.

## Deployment & Scaling

- Local development with Vite and Express.js.
- Production-ready for cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Scalable database and caching (PostgreSQL, Redis).
- PWA features for offline access and mobile usability.

## Summary

Jal Drishti integrates mapping, reporting, prediction, and equity analysis into a unified workflow, empowering rural communities and authorities to manage water resources proactively and equitably. The system is modular, scalable, and designed for real-world impact.
